### About Me
Hi!  I am Dylan van der Walt, a senior at Loyola University Maryland studying in BioHealth with a concentration on Commercialization and minoring in Marketing.  I am fascinated about the merging of healthcare, technology, and business, particularly how innovative medical products can improve patient outcomes.  I'm highly motivated, competitive, and team-oriented, all of which I developed throughout my four years as a Division I men's soccer player at Loyola.  Whether on the field or in a professional setting, I bring a strong work ethic, resilience, and a desire to learn every day.
