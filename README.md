### About Me
Hi!  I am Dylan van der Walt, a senior at Loyola University Maryland studying in BioHealth with a concentration on Commercialization and minoring in Marketing.  I am fascinated about the merging of healthcare, technology, and business, particularly how innovative medical products can improve patient outcomes.  I'm highly motivated, competitive, and team-oriented, all of which I developed throughout my four years as a Division I men's soccer player at Loyola.  Whether on the field or in a professional setting, I bring a strong work ethic, resilience, and a desire to learn every day.

### Projects

#### Making a schedule

- For this assignment, I created a fully organized Microsoft Outlook weekly calendar to manage my academic schedule. I added all five of my recurring classes, plus additional events, and applied a color-coding system to show differences in course types and priorities.

#### Creating a budget tracker

- In this project, I created a multi-worksheet Excel workbook to track inventory for a fake small business. I built a list of 10+ items and included key product details such as purchase price, selling price, item category, and other relevant information. Using formulas, I calculated the estimated profit and flagged whether each item’s profit margin should be improved.
